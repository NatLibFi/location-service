location-service
================

The Location Service is a wayfinding application for libraries. It provides additional information and map-based guidance to books and collections by showing their location on a map, and it can be integrated with any library management system or discovery tool, as the integration is done by adding a link to the Location Service in a library's search interface.

The main purpose of the application is to help library users to locate publications in a library by showing their location on a map. In addition to the map-based guidance, the Location Service also provides other information about the location, which should help the user to navigate through stacks of books. Elaborate collection and classification codes often used in the call number are presented in a form which is understandable to any library user. Displaying subject matters or images related to the location are also possible, and the use of images is recommended as it creates a link between the virtual and real word.
